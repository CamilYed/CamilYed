I am a software engineer with over 10 years of experience in industries such as **e-commerce**, **fintech**, and **HR-tech**. I value precision and pragmatism in designing solutions. My approach to software engineering goes beyond just coding — I strive to understand the **strategic needs of the organizations** I work for and build solutions that align with those goals.

## ✨ My Philosophy of Software Engineering  
- **Engineer, not just a developer**: For me, being an engineer means more than just writing code. It’s about understanding how software generates value and fits into the broader goals of an organization.  
- **Software should create real business value**: I believe software should never exist just for the sake of itself. Mature engineers must adopt a **strategic, business-oriented perspective**, understanding how the company operates, its domains, and its value streams. This is key to delivering solutions that drive tangible outcomes.

## 🚀 Key Interests  
I am deeply interested in **software architecture modernization**, particularly designing systems that are **scalable**, **maintainable**, and **evolutionary**. My approach to software architecture focuses on key principles that enable long-term success and adaptability:

- **Modularization**: Breaking down large, complex systems into smaller, more manageable components that can evolve independently. This not only helps streamline development but also ensures that systems remain flexible and easier to scale over time.  
- **Evolutionary Architecture**: Designing systems that can evolve alongside the business. The architecture must support continuous improvement, allowing teams to incrementally introduce new features or update existing ones without disrupting the overall system. This requires a focus on minimizing friction in the development process.  
- **Seamless Adaptation**: Ensuring that the system can easily adapt to changing business needs, technological advancements, and user demands. This helps organizations remain competitive in an ever-changing landscape.  
- **Operational Excellence**: Building software with operational efficiency in mind, ensuring that systems are not only functional but also reliable, observable, and easy to maintain in production.
