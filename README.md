- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CamilYed and I work as a Software Engineer at Allegro.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in and follow topics related to Domain Driven Design, Event Storming and software design.
     Another area that interests me is the Java Virtual Machine and more and more often bare-metal programming.
     
     Technologies are only technologies...
     
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning REACT.
